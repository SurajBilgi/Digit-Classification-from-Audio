# 🔧 PyTorch 2.6 Compatibility Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: Model Loading Error**

### **Problem**
```
❌ Error: Weights only load failed. This file can still be loaded, to do so you have two options...
WeightsUnpickler error: Unsupported global: GLOBAL numpy._core.multiarray.scalar...
```

### **Root Cause**
PyTorch 2.6 changed the default value of `weights_only` argument in `torch.load` from `False` to `True` for security reasons. Your trained model contains numpy objects that are now blocked by default.

### **Fix Applied** ✅
Updated `src/inference/predictor.py` line 58:

**Before:**
```python
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path, map_location=self.device)
```

**After:**
```python
# Load with weights_only=False for compatibility with PyTorch 2.6+
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path, map_location=self.device, weights_only=False)
```

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

### **Your trained model should now load correctly:**

```bash
# Activate your environment
conda activate audioLLM

# Test inference
python src/inference/predictor.py --model_path models/best_model.pth

# Test microphone integration
python src/microphone/live_predictor.py --model_path models/best_model.pth --interactive
```

## 🎯 **What This Fix Does**

1. **Allows numpy objects** in saved models (your training results, model weights)
2. **Maintains compatibility** with both old and new PyTorch versions
3. **Keeps security conscious** - only use with trusted model files (which yours are!)
4. **No retraining needed** - works with your existing trained model

---

## 🔒 **Security Note**

The `weights_only=False` parameter allows loading models with arbitrary Python objects. This is safe for:
- ✅ Models you trained yourself
- ✅ Models from trusted sources
- ✅ Your current setup

For production deployment with untrusted models, you'd want to use `weights_only=True` and ensure model compatibility.

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

After the fix, you should see:
```
Inference device: cpu
Loaded lightweight model
Feature type: mfcc
Input shape: (13, 32)
Warming up model...
Model warmed up!
```

Instead of the previous error.

**The fix is applied and ready to test!** 🚀
